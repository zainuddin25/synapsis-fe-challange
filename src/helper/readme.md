# HELPER FOLDER

A folder used to store a function that can be used many times in many different files, to make it easier and to avoid repeating the same code many times

### for example there is a limitData.ts file
in this file I created a function to limit the data in the return function, it has 3 params, namely
- data: is a large collection of data
- start: is the beginning of a data restriction on the return
- end: is the end of a data restriction in the return

and the function returns data that has been limited, for my case, I want to limit user data to 10 when I want to display it.
